        <li class="vaccinations__question">Q. Do I still need to follow norms after taking the vaccine?</li>
        <li class="vaccinations__answer">A. The usual protocol needs to be followed. One should continue to wear masks,
            wash their hands
            (or sanitize their hands), follow social distancing and maintain good hygiene. Immunisation
            does not prevent another infection when exposed
            but only reduces the severity of symptoms and prevents it from advancing.
            COVID-19 vaccine prevents hospitalisation and death.</li>
