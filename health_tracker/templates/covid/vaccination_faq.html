                        <li>A. Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the 
                            complete schedule of COVID-19 vaccine for protecting oneself against this disease and also to limit 
                            the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and 
                            co-workers.</li>

                        <li>Q. Is it important for me to receive the same vaccine during second dose?</li>
                        <li>As the vaccines available are not interchangeable, it is important to receive 
                            the second dose of same vaccine as the first one. The Co-WIN portal is also going 
                            to help to ensure that everyone receives the same vaccine.</li>

                        <li>Q. In how many days will the vaccination create an adequate immune response and protection?</li>
                        <li>A. Adequate immune response takes 2-3 weeks after completion of entire vaccination schedule i.e., 
                            after the second dose of COVISHIELD速 and COVAXIN速.</li>

                        <li>Q. Do I still need to follow norms after taking the vaccine?</li>
                        <li>A. The usual protocol needs to be followed. One should continue to wear masks, wash their hands 
                            (or sanitize their hands), follow social distancing and maintain good hygiene. Immunisation 
                            does not prevent another infection when exposed     
                            but only reduces the severity of symptoms and prevents it from advancing.   
                            COVID-19 vaccine prevents hospitalisation and death.</li>

                            mild fever and irritability. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Side effects should go away in a few days.</li>
                        <li>Get the second dose even if you have side effects from the first shot, unless a 
                            vaccination provider or doctor advices you otherwise.
